# 🔗 Linked List Visualizer

A simple web-based visualizer built to understand and demonstrate core **linked list data structure operations** through step-by-step animations.

---

## 🔹 Overview

This project helps visualize how linked list operations work internally by showing node traversal, insertion, deletion, search, and reversal in a clear, interactive manner.  
It is designed as a **learning and concept-building tool**, not a production application.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Visual representation of a singly linked list
- Step-by-step animation of operations:
  - Insert at a position
  - Delete at a position
  - Search for a value
  - Reverse the linked list
- Highlights active nodes during traversal
- Displays textual explanations alongside animations

---

## 🔹 How It Works (High Level)

1. User selects a linked list operation from the UI  
2. The operation is broken down into logical steps  
3. Each step is animated to show traversal or modification  
4. The linked list updates visually after each operation  

The project separates:
- data structure logic  
- visualization steps  
- rendering and animation  

to keep the code understandable and modular.

---

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic)
- ES Modules

---

## 🔹 Running the Project

This project uses **JavaScript ES Modules**, which require a local HTTP server due to browser security restrictions.

### Recommended:
- Open the project using **VS Code Live Server**

Opening `index.html` directly using `file://` will not work correctly.

---

## 🔹 Learning Goals

- Understand linked list behavior beyond theory
- Visualize traversal and pointer changes
- Practice basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Build intuition for data structure operations

---

## 🔹 Notes

This project was built as a learning exercise with a focus on **conceptual clarity** rather than advanced JavaScript techniques or frameworks.

---

## 🔹 Author

Built as a learning project to strengthen understanding of **data structures and algorithm visualization**.
